v1.1.1e [20201112 (pinterf)]
   - Update internal VERSION with 'e' shown in 'info' pages
   - New: Add (debug) parameter: 'mode_9_to_15bits' (integer). Values 0, 1 (default), 2
          Affects how less-than-16-bit formats are handled internally.
          Result is the same, speed may vary
   - New: VapourSynth: support for all bit depth between 8 and 16
   - Fix: VapourSynth: check if format is 4:4:4 for parameter channels="YUV" (was: crash)
   - New: VapourSynth: If OpenCL driver does not support special 10-10-10 bit internal processing mode, 
                       silently fallbacks to the new high bit depth normal mode instead of 
                       "format not supported"

v1.1.1d [20201102 (pinterf)]
   - Fix: Avisynth: channels="UV" gives error on greyscale clips with bit depth > 8
   - Fix: Avisynth: YV24 text in a parameter checking error replaced to bit depth independent 4:4:4
   - Fix: Avisynth: channels="UV" was working only for 8 bit subsampled formats
   - Fix: Avisynth: channels="UV" to properly support 4:1:1 subsampling
   - New: Avisynth: add planar RGB support
   - New: Avisynth: add general support for 9-15 bit input formats (avs: 10, 12, 14)
   - New: Avisynth: 10 bit input processing is no longer restricted to channels="YUV"
   - New: Avisynth: If OpenCL driver does not support special 10-10-10 bit internal processing mode, 
                    silently fallbacks to the new high bit depth normal mode instead of 
                    "format not supported"
